**Assignment 2 Recap**
--------------

**Notes:**
Added tooltips to all the visualizations
Created one bar chart for one variable with even spacing on axes
Created examples in Tableau for all the charts as well. I actually started with those because it was easier than p5.js
I used a logarithmic scale (log10) on the second graph because the scale is skewed due to the massive range
